The answer to this question is multifaceted. The major motivator was the sudden need to support my father after his stroke. I tried supporting him in my current career, but I just couldn‚Äôt accomplish that with my current salary. I also couldn‚Äôt move up with my current employer. This realization is what got me started about switching careers, or at least looking for another job. 

I had always been intrigued by the ‚Äòmystique of the coder‚Äô, someone who could delve into the depths of the computer to make it do anything they wanted, and thought about learning how to do it myself one day. I began by taking a few classes at my local community college as a cheaper way to see if I would truly enjoy this profession. After completing there computer programing fundamental courses, I was hooked. I loved the process of creating something from nothing, the struggle of working  on a program for days and it to not do what I want, and suddenly realize the solution to see my creation work perfectly. 

I knew the switch in careers would be no simple task. I would be starting again from the ground floor. I initially wanted to follow the traditional education course and get my masters, but I needed to get into the field rather quickly. This is why I chose to go to a coding bootcamp. I would be able to reletively quickly find a job with a greater salary. Once established in the field i would then be able to go back and get my masters. As I've read, this will also give me more vertical mobility. Hopefully one day I'll be able to look back and know that i made the right decision. ü§ûüèª
